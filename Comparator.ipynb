    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook was designed to provide control over- and visualise different numerical integration schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Namely: \n",
    "    - Fixed Timestep methods:\n",
    "        - Euler, Verlet, and Runge-Kutta 4\n",
    "    - Adaptive method:\n",
    "        - Runge-Kutta Dormand Prince 5(4)\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual work is done behind-the-scenes by the Python 3 scripts that this notebook calls (using the %run linemagic). These files must be present.\n",
    "Visualisation is done using Bokeh and matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "    1. Run the first cell calling jupyter_init.py. Set the parameters, then\n",
    "    2. Run the cell %run -i -t ./src/comp.py. This is the actual numerical integration.\n",
    "    3... The rest is pretty straightforward. There are short explanations before every runnable cell."
