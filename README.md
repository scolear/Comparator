# How-to

The user is meant to interact with the Jupyter Notebook called Comparator.ipynb. Since it calls local files using linemagics, the surrounding folders must be present on the users local machine.

To run the software as it is intended:

1. Download the following:
   * Comparator.ipynb
   * *src* folder
   * *addendum* folder
   * *logs* folder
   * *Hint:* You could just download the whole master as ZIP.
   
1. Run Comparator.ipynb on a local kernel
1. Follow the instructions therein

## Required packages
The underlying source code is written in Python 3. It makes use of several packages; some that might not be included in every python distribution are:

1. ipywidgets
1. pandas
1. numpy
1. bokeh

*Hint:* All of the above are part of the standard Anaconda distribution.
